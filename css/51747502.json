The triangle XYZ is an isosceles right triangle so the length of each leg is 3. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the height of the square, the diameter is equal to 3. So the radius is equal to 1.5 inches.Alternatively, since the sides XY and ZY are equal, set them equal to x. Then 2x\u00b2 = (3\u221a2)\u00b2 by the Pythagorean Theorem. Solving for x: x\u00b2 = 9 and so x = 3. Since x represents the side of the square or the diameter of the circle, we divide by 2 to get the radius. So, the radius must be 1.5.

Scientists have been unable to prove the organism's infectivity because samples could not be isolated from diseased individuals, grown in the laboratory in pure culture and then used to re-infect an experimental animal, thus establishing causation. An alternative view suggests that the primary obstacle to isolation of the Legionella bacterium is scientists' inability to view it microscopically. The conventional staining technique employed for creating bacterial samples was ineffective with the Legionella bacterium; although there was circumstantial evidence of an organism present on specimen slides, the lack of contrast between the unstained organism and the glass slide itself rendered the bacterium practically invisible. Although no conclusive evidence exists to prove unequivocally that either theory is correct, many scholars believe that both are viable explanations.

Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in the plaza. There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the plaza. Thus, we recommend that the city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. If skateboarding is prohibited here, we predict that business in Central Plaza will return to its previously high levels.&#34;Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result.
